# Streamer.bot Alerts

This project exists to allow for a streamer using OBS or Streamlabs (or anything that supports adding an HTML source) to have simple, functional alert overlays with minimal configuration. I created this project as I wanted to remove my dependence on streamelements, and having alert overlay reactions for things like Cheers, Raids, etc. was a significant hurtle.

After some (too much) research, I realized that by using the streamerbot websocket client, I could build my own system, and thus this project was born. This is a living project as I run into more functionality (and bugs therein) with a laundry-list of things I wish to support. I am also happy to have PR requests in fixing issues, adding functionality, etc.

> [!NOTE]
> This project is not for large and elaborate alert reactions! You'll want to get your hands dirty with streamer.bot and OBS (or whatever) to perform more elaborate actions, but this will get you some simple, easy alerts with minimal setup.

## Current functionality

This project currently supports the following Twitch events:

- Follow
- Cheer
- Raid
- Sub
- ReSub
- GiftSub
- GiftBomb

A Quick look at features:

- custom images per alert type
- custom sounds per alert type
- custom text for alert titles and details
- option to inject users' message instead of detail message
- supports browser Text-to-speech (with overrides for each event type)
- supports overrides for certain events for specific interactions

## Getting started

1. Install [Streamer.bot](https://streamer.bot), and connect it to Twitch.
1. Turn on the Websocket Server:
   ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/525b2405-ff56-4bdb-a45b-3936b95f7b4f)
1. Add a new browser source in your streaming tool, and set it to point to the Alerts.html file of this project:
   ![image-1](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6e743129-83cf-4c78-b8ea-211fe60ee461)
1. [Set up your alert reactions](#alert-setup) in the `scripts/config.js` file.

> [!NOTE]
> To enable KoFi integration, please refer to the connection instructions found in the [Streamer.Bot KoFi integration page](https://docs.streamer.bot/guide/integrations/ko-fi).

## Global config

There are some global settings used for the defaults for alerts:

```javascript
// The default amount of time, in milliseconds that the alert will be displayed for
const defaultEventDisplayTime = 5000;

// if false no Text-To-Speech will fire, regardless of settings
const enableTTS = false;

// look at https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/SpeechSynthesis for more info on TTS props and voices
const defaultTTSSettings = {
  cheerThreshold: 100, // only applies to Twitch.Cheer events currently
  delay: 1000,
  pitch: 1,
  rate: 1.3,
  voice: "Zira",
  volume: 1,
};
```

There are also a number of variables you can use to set some of the CSS variables through the config js if you don't want to mess around with the CSS file:

```javascript
// CSS variable settings

// If you want to use these overrides, set this to true
const useCSSVariables = false;
// color of message
const primaryTextColor = "#ffffff";
// color of alert title
const titleColor = "#00eeae";
// text shadow applied to both message and title
const textShadow =
  "0px 0px 2px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.85), 0px 0px 4px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.7)";
// the fonts you want to use. These fonts need to be installed on your system if you want them to work.
const fontStack = "'Montserrat-optimized', Monserrat, Verdana, sans-serif";
// how fast the alert should animate in
const animateInSpeed = "2s";
// how fast the alert should animate out
const animateOutSpeed = "2s";
// how fast the image of the alert should animate in
const imgAnimateInSpeed = "2.5s";
// how fast the image of the alert should animate out
const imgAnimateOutSpeed = "2.5s";
```

## Alerts Setup

Inside of the config.js file is a variable called `eventResponseStructure`. each key of that is related to an event emitted by streamerbot. When an alert is triggered, the code will select a random title, message, image, and sound for the alert from the configuration therein.

> [!NOTE]
> For all titles and messages (as well as the anonymous options) the event details are injected in as keys that can be used as token replacement. For example: `{displayName}` will be replaced with the `displayName` value from the triggered event. This will work for any value, but it's primative replacement so expect JS shenanigans.

#### Example:

```javascript
const eventResponseStructure = {
  "Twitch.Follow": {
    // Event name
    title: ["New Follower"],
    message: ["Welcome {displayName}!", "Howdy {displayName}!"],
    images: ["images/welcome-1.webp"],
    sounds: ["sounds/alert-follow.mp3"],
    duration: 8000,
  },
  "Twitch.Cheer": {
    title: ["{displayName} gave bits!"],
    anonTitle: ["Bits!"],
    message: ["Thanks for the {bits} bits, {displayName}"],
    anonMessage: ["Thanks for the {bits} bits, anonymous patron!"],
    images: ["images/cheer-1.webp"],
    sounds: ["sounds/alert-cheer.mp3"],
    duration: 4000,
  },
};
```

> [!NOTE]
> For a full list of possible events, please refer to the [streamer.bot documentation](https://streamerbot.github.io/client/api/events) that lists all possible emitted events.

> [!NOTE]
> For details for all of the Twitch events sent from streamer.bot, please refer to the events list from the [streamer.bot documentation](https://docs.streamer.bot/api/servers/websocket/events/twitch).

| showUserMessage  | `bool`                              | if true, will render the users message instead of a config message                                     | Cheer, Sub, ReSub                     |
| textToSpeech     | `bool`                              | if true, will attempt to use TTS to read the message. Only used if `showUserMessage` is also true      | Cheer, Sub, ReSub                     |

| exclusions       | `[string\|int]`                     | excludes the alert when specific conditions met. Refer to [variants](#variants) section for conditions | Cheer, Raid, ReSub, GiftSub, GiftBomb |

### TTS Object structure

With the exception of `delay` and `cheerThreshold` all of the values of these props are derrived from the [Speech Synthesis Utterance API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/SpeechSynthesisUtterance)
| Prop | Type | Explanation |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| voice | `string` | name of voice to use. Please check your browser's default language |
| pitch | `float between 0 and 2` | pitch adjustment for the voice |
| rate | `float between 0.1 and 10` | speed adjustment for text playback |
| volume | `float between 0 and 1` | volume adjustment for text playback |
| delay | `int` | value in milliseconds to delay the text playback |
| cheerThreshold | `int` | **only used for cheer events** how many bits need to be given to enable TTS |

### Variants

Variants are special alert replacements when certain conditions are met. Each event type that can have a variant will have a comparison value that is used in check:

| Event Type | Comparison Value   |
| ---------- | ------------------ |
| Cheer      | `bits`             |
| Raid       | `viewerCount`      |
| ReSub      | `cumulativeMonths` |
| GiftSub    | `totalSubsGifted`  |
| GiftBomb   | `gifts`            |

Currently there are 3 variant types you can use:

| Variant        | Explanation                                                                             | Example usage | matches               |
| -------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------- | --------------------- |
| exact match    | Will match when the comparison value matches the target exactly                         | `100`         | 100 matches           |
| range match    | Will match when the comparison value falls within the target range values (inclusively) | `100-200`     | 100, 105, 200 matches |
| multiple match | Will match when the comparison value is a multiple of the target value                  | `x100`        | 100, 200, 300 matches |

> [!WARNING]
> There is a hierarchy to the matching. Exact match is first, then ranges, and finally multiples. When multiple matches are found with ranges or multiples, the first match will be used.

#### Example:

```javascript
const eventResponseStructure = {
  "Twitch.Cheer": {
    title: ["{displayName} gave bits!"],
    anonTitle: ["Bits!"],
    message: ["Thanks for the {bits} bits, {displayName}"],
    anonMessage: ["Thanks for the {bits} bits, anonymous patron!"],
    images: ["images/cheer-1.webp"],
    sounds: ["sounds/alert-cheer.mp3"],
    showUserMessage: true,
    duration: 4000,
    textToSpeech: true,
    exclusions: [],
    tts: {
      delay: 3000,
    },
    variants: {
      100: {
        title: ["special event!"],
        tts: {
          delay: 3000,
        },
      },
      "100-200": {
        title: ["This is a range event!"],
      },
      "100-300": {
        title: [
          "This will never fire for anything between 100-200, because the previous range matches",
        ],
      },
      x500: {
        title: ["This is a multiple match"],
      },
    },
  },
};
```

## CSS information

If you want to get your hands dirty with the CSS, go nuts! I pulled the bounce animation from [Nelle de Jones](https://codepen.io/nelledejones/pen/gOOPWrK)'s codepen post, and in there you can find many other examples if the bounce doesn't do it for you. If you just want to change the variables you can do that using the [Global config](#global-config).

## Future plans/ideas:

- [ ] support other platforms (YouTube is next on the list) (please contribute!)
- [x] additional variants support
- [x] equalize exclusions to variants
- [ ] code clean-up
- [ ] Config tool (no-code config creation)
- [ ] Separate project for Chat client using WebSocket
